# 🚀 Deploy Thundr to Vercel - START HERE

## ✅ Your App is Ready!

I've configured Thundr to work **exactly like [thunderx](https://github.com/xtoazt/thunderx)** with static UV proxy on Vercel!

## Quick Deploy (30 seconds)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy (from your project directory)
vercel
```

**That's it!** Follow the prompts and your site will be live.

## What Changed

✅ **UV Static Proxy** - No server needed, works client-side
✅ **Games from static JSON** - Loads from `/assets/js/json/games.json`
✅ **Service worker configured** - Handles proxy routing
✅ **Update popup added** - Your custom message shows on first visit
✅ **Build working** - `npm run build` completes successfully
✅ **All proxy files included** - UV, Scramjet, BareMux in dist
