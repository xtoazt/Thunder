## 🎯 How It Works

Like thunderx, this uses:
1. **UV static proxy** - Runs in browser via service worker
2. **BareMux** - Client-side transport layer
3. **Static JSON** - Games loaded directly from files
4. **No backend needed** - 100% static deployment

# Build
npm run build

# Test locally

**Note:** Using UV static proxy like thunderx means no backend server needed. All proxy functionality runs client-side in the browser through service workers.
