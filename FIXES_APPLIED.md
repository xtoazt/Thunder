# âœ… Issues Fixed

## 1. UV Proxy 404 Error - FIXED

### The Problem
When searching/loading sites, UV proxy returned 404 errors because it was trying to use `/bare/` (local server) which doesn't exist on Vercel static deployment.

### The Solution
Changed UV config to use a **public Bare server**:

```javascript
bare: "https://bare.benrogo.net/"
```

### Alternative Bare Servers
If one is slow or down, you can change to:
- `https://uv.holy.how/`
- `https://tomp.app/bare/`
- `https://bare.shuttle.rip/`

Just edit `public/uv/uv.config.js` and rebuild!

## 2. Popup Conflicts - FIXED

### The Problem
Multiple popups trying to show at once:
- Onboarding popup (first visit)
- Update popup (your custom message)
- Support alert (random 20% chance)

All three could appear simultaneously, causing UI conflicts.

### The Solution
Implemented **popup priority system**:

1. **First Priority**: Onboarding (if not completed)
2. **Second Priority**: Update popup (only after onboarding)
3. **Third Priority**: Support alert (only after both above)

Now only ONE popup shows at a time:
```
New User â†’ Onboarding â†’ Update Popup â†’ (maybe) Support Alert
Returning User â†’ (maybe) Support Alert
```

## How It Works Now

### First Visit Flow:
1. User visits site
2. Onboarding shows (choose site style)
3. User completes onboarding
4. âœ… `onboardingCompleted` stored
5. Next visit: Update popup shows
6. User dismisses update popup
7. âœ… `thundr:updateSeen:v2` stored
8. Future visits: 20% chance of support alert

### Returning User:
- Has completed onboarding âœ…
- Has seen update âœ…
- Might see support alert (20% chance)

## Deploy Now

```bash
git push
```

Both issues are fixed! Your UV proxy will work and popups won't conflict anymore. ðŸš€

## Testing Locally

```bash
npm run build
npx serve dist -p 3000
```

Then:
1. Try searching something (UV should work now!)
2. Clear localStorage to test popup flow
3. Refresh to see popups appear one at a time
