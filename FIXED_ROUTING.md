# ✅ FIXED: Vercel Routing Issue

## The Problem

Vercel was returning `index.html` for all routes, including the proxy JavaScript files:
- `/scram/scramjet.controller.js` → returned HTML ❌
- `/uv/uv.bundle.js` → returned HTML ❌
- `/uv/uv.config.js` → returned HTML ❌

This caused the error:
```
Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded 
with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

## The Solution

Added `"handle": "filesystem"` to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"  // ← This tells Vercel to serve static files first
    },
    {
      "src": "/service/(.*)",
      "dest": "/uv/uv.sw.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"  // Only catch unmatched routes
    }
  ]
}
```

## What This Does

1. **First:** Check if a physical file exists
2. **Second:** Apply routing rules
3. **Last:** Catch-all to index.html for React Router

Now:
- `/scram/scramjet.controller.js` → serves the actual JS file ✅
- `/uv/uv.bundle.js` → serves the actual JS file ✅
- `/` → serves index.html ✅

## Deploy Now

```bash
git push
```

The deployment will now work correctly! 🚀

## What Was Fixed

✅ pnpm lockfile regenerated
✅ Vercel routing fixed with filesystem handler
✅ Static files will be served correctly
✅ Proxy scripts will load properly

Your site will be live in ~1 minute after pushing!
