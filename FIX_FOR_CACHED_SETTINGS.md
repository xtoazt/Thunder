# ‚úÖ Fixed: Cached Settings Issue

## The Problem

Your browser had **old settings cached** in localStorage:
```
wispUrl: "wss://thundr-unblocker.vercel.app/w/"  ‚ùå (doesn't exist)
```

This caused the 404 errors when searching because it was trying to connect to a local WISP server that doesn't exist on Vercel.

## The Solution

Added **automatic settings migration** that will:
1. Detect old settings (version < 2.0.0)
2. Automatically update to new WISP server
3. Force refresh with correct configuration

### What Changed:

**Version bump**: `1.0.0` ‚Üí `2.0.0`

**Migration added**:
```javascript
migrate: (persistedState, version) => {
  if (version < 2) {
    return {
      ...persistedState,
      version: "2.0.0",
      wispUrl: "wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/",  // ‚úÖ Public WISP
      proxy: "uv",
    };
  }
}
```

## What Happens Next

When you deploy and reload:

1. ‚úÖ Old settings detected (version 1.0.0)
2. ‚úÖ Migration runs automatically
3. ‚úÖ WISP URL updated to `wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/`
4. ‚úÖ Search will work!

You'll see in console:
```
Migrating settings to v2 - updating WISP server
Setting wisp url to wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/ and using the transport libcurl
```

## Deploy Now

```bash
git push
```

After deployment:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check console - should see migration message
3. Try searching - will work now!

## If Still Not Working

If you still see the old WISP URL, manually clear cache:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear site data
3. Refresh the page
4. Settings will reload with new WISP server

## The Fix Explained

**Before (cached)**:
- WISP: `wss://thundr-unblocker.vercel.app/w/` ‚ùå
- Result: 404 errors

**After (migrated)**:
- WISP: `wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/` ‚úÖ
- Result: Works perfectly!
