# UV Fix & Theme Update üé®

## ‚úÖ UV Proxy Issues Fixed

### Problem
UV was giving `TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL` errors because:
1. URLs were being double-encoded with `encodeURIComponent`
2. UV service worker couldn't properly decode the mangled URLs
3. The routing pattern was too complex

### Solution
1. **Simplified URL Routing**: Changed from `/~/uv/{encodedUrl}` to `/~/service/{url}`
   - UV's service worker now handles all URL encoding/decoding internally
   - No more manual encoding with `encodeURIComponent`
   - Direct URL passing: `/~/service/https://example.com`

2. **Updated UV Config**: Changed prefix from `/~/uv/` to `/~/service/`

3. **Better Error Handling**: Service worker now catches UV fetch errors properly

4. **Fixed All References**:
   - Default mode search
   - Browser mode tabs
   - Bookmark clicks
   - All iframe src attributes

### Files Changed
- `public/uv/uv.config.js` - Changed prefix
- `public/sw.js` - Better fetch handler with error catching
- `src/components/homeComponents/default.tsx` - Simplified URL handling
- `src/components/homeComponents/tabbed.tsx` - Simplified URL handling

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Clear Service Workers** in DevTools:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
   - Click "Unregister" on all workers
   - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Test UV Proxy**:
   - Try searching for something: "hi"
   - Try visiting a website: "google.com"
   - Should work without "Invalid URL" errors

3. **Check Theme**:
   - All primary buttons should be purple
   - Focus rings should be purple
   - Accent colors should be blue

## üéØ What's Next

If UV still doesn't work after clearing service workers:
1. The error fallback page will show
2. Users can click "Use Backup Site" ‚Üí https://so-tuff.teamgaming.pw/
3. No broken experience for users!

## üìù Technical Notes

**Why `/~/service/` works better:**
- UV's XOR codec is designed to handle raw URLs
- The service worker route handler checks for `/~/service/` prefix
- UV internally encodes/decodes using its own XOR algorithm
- No need for double encoding with JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent`

**Color Values:**
- Purple: `hsl(262, 83%, 58%)` - Vibrant purple with high saturation
- Blue: `hsl(220, 70%, 50%)` - Deep blue for accents
- Both colors work well together in dark mode
